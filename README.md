# webscraping-

For extracting data from **Google Weather** we used two **libraries HTMLSession** and **requests**. 

HTMLSession is a class in the Python library requests-html that provides a convenient way to make HTTP requests and parse HTML content. It is built on top of the popular requests library and the lxml HTML parsing library.


The requests library is a popular Python library for making HTTP requests. It provides a simple and intuitive way to interact with web APIs and web pages, and supports a wide range of HTTP methods, authentication methods, and request parameters.

The stages of this project have been clarfied by # before any formula. 
In **"query"** varaible any city can be mentioned then through **f-string** the city mentioned is called through a string format.
